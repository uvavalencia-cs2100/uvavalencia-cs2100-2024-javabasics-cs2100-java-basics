## Assignment 1

Create a class named _SumOfInts.java_ with a runnable public main method which will determine from a prefixed array of int if the specified input parameter is the sum of two of the array elements:

Notes:
- Use the input _args_ parameters of the main method.
- Print the two numbers of the array which sum is the specified in the input parameter
- Print all the occurrences of two numbers


## Assignment 2

Create a class named _GuessNumber.java_ with a runnable public main method which will be in charge of guessing an initial random number.

Notes:
- Do this in Java
- The initial random number needs to be created at the begining and within the range from 0 to 100
- The program will need to read the user input and determine if the number is the exact, lower or higher.
- In case of not matching the expected number, help the user printing if it is higher or lower.
- The program will not end until the number is found or the input text "quit" is found. 
- only use this knowladge of arrays : 
Declare an array: 
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

Get the element of an array

int first_number = numbers[0]; 


## Assignment 3

Create a class named _Factorial.java_ that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

Notes:
- Use the input _args_ parameters of the main method.


## Assignment 4


Create a class named _PrimeNumber.java_ that checks whether a given input parameter is number prime or not

Notes:
- Use the input _args_ parameters of the main method.

## Assignment 5

Create a class named _FindMinMax.java_ that ask the user to input **n** numbers into an array and find the maximum and minimum value in that array.

Notes:
- First argument is the number of elements in the array
- Next arguments are the elements of the array
